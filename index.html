        <p>Hello! My name is Gustavo Freire Prata dos Santos and I am from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 
            <br><br>
            I am a functional specialist, technical expert, and IT architect with extensive experience in software development, technical leadership, and systems architecture. I have deep knowledge in Java, PL/SQL, WebLogic, Apache HttpClient, and Oracle infrastructure.
            <br><br>
            Currently, I work as a Technical Lead, ensuring the quality and efficiency of developing robust and scalable solutions. My approach combines strategic vision and technical expertise, always striving to optimize processes and improve system performance.
            <br><br>
            In my leisure time, I enjoy exploring emerging technologies, such as virtual reality, and I am always looking for innovative tools to enhance my programming and entertainment experience. I am passionate about travel, cinema, and sports, and I value activities that combine learning and intellectual challenges.
            <br><br>
            I am currently expanding my academic background by taking Web Fundamentals (WDD130) at BYU Idaho, strengthening my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and web development. My goal is to continue evolving both in the technical field and in management and leadership, always seeking positive impact and innovation in the technology sector.</p>
